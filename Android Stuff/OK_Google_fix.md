# Fix "Okay Google" not working on Custom ROMs with (any) Gapps Package Flashed 

### Cause: Google app isnt a system app (/system/priv-app)

### Fix: Systemize Google App : **BUT THERE IS A CATCH**

Prerequisites : Root Access, Working Brain and common sense

  1. Install an older version of Google App (atleast 6 months old)
  2. Systemize that (use the systemize module or whatever means but put Google/Velvet app in /system/priv-app)
  3. After reboot, update Google App from Play Store and issue solved
