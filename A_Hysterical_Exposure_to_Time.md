# A Hysterical Exposure to Time

*21 February 2023*

```
He stood there still, peering into my eyes;
his hair messier than I could imagine,
muscles bulkier than I thought it would be.
But the sheer frown on his face,
atleast that was well preserved.

Ten years worth of chit chats,
we passed through a single eye contact;
Not sure if I saw him weep,
but he sure was mumbling these words,
"None of those closed doors ever opened."

"I didn't expect them to open either."

Everything I've always wanted,
he had all of them that could be bought.
Didn't take me long to see, 
that the ones that were missing,
were the ones I wanted the most.

He told me where things went south,
where things went out of hands.
Some of them, I saw were inevitable;
the rest, well, laid far away,
far away from my notions!

My ten-year-older self stood trembling,
He didn't know if he should blame me,
or feel sorry for what he has done.
We embraced each other, sobbed a bit.
and thus broke every law of time.

but different timelines, as it will be now.

We hated how time worked,
how it splits and moves forward;
the bleak possibility of amendments,
the bleak possibility of fixing us.
We believed in hating reality.

"So you took all this pain and travelled back,
knowing that there's little I could do?"
