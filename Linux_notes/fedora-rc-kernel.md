Not at all recommended but if you are like me and has no personal life, 

https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=8

u can get all of the latest release candidate kernel RPMs from here. 

As of writing this, I have successfully installed `6.7.0-0.rc4.20231206gitbee0e7762ad2.37.fc40.x86_64` meant for Fedora 40 on Fedora 39. 

Whatever version you choose, u need to download these RPMs

- kernel-devel-\<version\>.\<architecture\>.rpm
- kernel-devel-matched-\<version\>.\<architecture\>.rpm
