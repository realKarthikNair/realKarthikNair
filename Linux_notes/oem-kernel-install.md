Just found out that some issues, like the device's built-in speaker not working on my new HP laptop, can be fixed without hassle by installing the OEM kernel.

```bash
# to search for the latest OEM kernels for 22.04 
apt search linux-oem-22.04
# install it using 'sudo apt install linux-oem-*" REPLACE * with the appropriate letter
