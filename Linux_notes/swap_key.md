I broke the *down arrow* key on my laptop and keyboard replacement was pretty costly.
SO I remapped (or swapped, anything you'd like to call it) it with Right Ctrl key as a dirty fix.

`/usr/share/X11/xkb/keycodes/evdev` is the file you need to mess up with

For instance, what I did was commenting the line that had the id and keycode for Right Ctrl key

and putting that id for down arrow key instead

It didn't work right upon saving the file so I had to give a reboot!

> This obviously isn't a permanent solution since this workaround ain't gonna work in the bios, for example. Also, getting accustomed to the swapped key is a pain...
