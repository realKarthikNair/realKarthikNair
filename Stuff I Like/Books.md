Books I've read and would recommend giving a read

| Title/Book Series Name | Author |  Genre | What would I rate it out of 10 | Why did I read it/them | Why that rating | Footnotes | 
--------- | -------- |  --------- | ------------------------ | ------ | ------| ---- |
| 1984 | George Orwell | Fiction/Science,Dystopian,Political | 9 | It was so popular | Plot makes a lot of sense | - | 
| Robert Langdon series | Dan Brown | Adventure/Crime, Detective, thriller, Mystery | 7 | It was the only complete book series available in my high-school library | Good plots but it stretches on details at bs levels | - |
| Harry Potter series | J. K.  Rowling | Literature,Fiction/Fantasy, Thriller | 9 | It was a global bestseller, peer-pressure from potterheads | The best fantasy books I have read to date | Read the novels even if you have watched the movie adapatations a million times | 
| Will Robie series | David Baldacci | Fiction/Thriller | 7 | I randomly picked 'The Innocent' and made me read the entire book series | Thriller enough | - | 
| No Man's Land | David Baldacci | Fiction/Thriller, Crime, War, Sci-Fi | 8 | It caught my attention in college library | Was so intriguing I kept reading it during all my spare time instead of socialising | You can skip it if you have already read tons of crime and semi-SciFi thriller books | 
| A Brief History of Time | Stephen Hawking | Science | 9 | I craved for science related stuff back in 2019 | _read it yourself_ | Skip if you aren't interested in science and related philosophy | 
| Revolution 2020 | Chetan Bhagat | Fiction/Politics, Romance | 7 | Had access to a hard copy for free + popular Indian author | Taught me a lot about India in a unique way | Try reading this one even if you think Chetan Bhagat books suck | 
| Contact | Carl Sagan | Fiction/Science | 9 | I loved the movie adaptation | Impressed me a lot, unique science fiction | JUST READ IT, or atleast watch [the movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118884/) |
| The Martian | Andy Weir | Fiction/Science | 8 | The movie adaptation | Cool idea | Easily skippable if you have watched the movie | 
    
I will keep updating this list whenever I read a book or  I recall any previous books I have read and 

- It feels commendable enough
    
- It doesn't give away any information about me/my personality that I keep private
