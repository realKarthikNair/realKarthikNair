# List of Movies and Series I've watched and liked/somewhat liked/loved

The list is **sorted alphabetically** by title.    

**The list is not exhaustive and will be updated** as I watch more movies and series or remember the ones I've watched.

"Genre" column might rarely represent my personal opinion on the genre of the movie/series instead of the actual genre it is believed to be.   
"Language" column represents the language in which I watched the movie/series.   
"Remarks/Opinions" column contains my personal opinions on the movie/series and is tried to be kept spoiler-free.

"Personal Rating" doesn't have a one-fit-all criteria, but thoughts on the plot, acting, cinematography, VFX, soundtracks, length, and overall experience are taken into account. It is not biased towards any particular genre or actors. It is a personal rating and might not align with the general ratings on IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes.

Good example of how a bollywood movie can be made with less bs and yet be entertaining.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 8.5               |

But there are so many flaws and scientific inaccuracies throughout the series which I really can not ignore, again being a nerd myself. Plus (spoiler) they discontinued the series and the last season (and thus the plot) ends in a stupid way. | 6.5               |
