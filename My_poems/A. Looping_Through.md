# Looping Through 

*January 16 2021*

    They say Hope is like a Star,
    it Shines, Shines and Ignites;
    Just as like those Plunging Petals,
    Didnt we lose our dreams?

    Faking them for so much Long,
    We did Yearn for Light;
    Deffering them for all those comforts,
    didnt we miss those Paths?

    Gliding all the odd ones out,
    gasping for some Fame;
    Thinking bout some Carefree Nights,
    didnt we miss the 'right'?

    No one knew that soothing tone,
    No one heard those screams;
    People whom we loved so far,
    were dwindling like a breeze

    Summing up those mid-night thoughts
    We did sleep so dull;
    Yawning up for day Long hours,
    We did lose the War...
