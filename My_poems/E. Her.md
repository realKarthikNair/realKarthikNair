# Her (might rename later)

*Wrote Somewhere around 2020, I would make major revisions/changes to this or even delete it later*

    She is a dream that lives in the moonlight 
    Smiles like a fool that stays in the darkside 
    Flying in the daylight playing with her demons
    Dances in the starlight swaying with her (e)motions

    Time was moving, she was taken
    Dragged with its motion, felt like an illussion
    Hearing the tear drops,  nothing could she do
    Jumping with the dew drops, nowhere could she go

    A castle was made, her dreams lay there
    Waiting in the void, she built it there
    Time has passed , it went somewhere
    No sort of feelings , it left her there

    Hopes were broken, she felt like a loner
    Walked on the streets,  hoped for a sobber
    None could she find , none could she get
    She was a dream who lived in the daylight
