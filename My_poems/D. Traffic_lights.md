# Traffic Lights

*May 13 2022*

    The cityscape was unhued that day,
    filled with dismay and lots of guilt.
    The silence engulfed so much that
    Those Dobermans did not bark.

    The violet wagon lost its charm,
    the eerie breeze did dull the star.
    It started hitting so much deep,
    that the clamor kid did lull to sleep

    Seems they all were muzzled up,
    staring at those ruthless lights.
    Most of them did lose their mind,
    To the extent they all did not care

    Then they saw her, the brunette girl
    resting on her mountain bike!
    Her silhouette dripped sweat around,
    but all she felt was fully bright

    How could she be so much cool,
    when the damn place did stink so much,
    How could she smile this way,
    when the sky above was turning dark

    Soon we saw the engines roar, 
    the city got on wheels.
    All of them turned so much green,
    the brunette was nowhere seen.
