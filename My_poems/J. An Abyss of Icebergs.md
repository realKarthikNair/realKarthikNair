# An Abyss of Icebergs

*6 February 2024*

    Patience is underrated,
    it's never valued, or even acknowledged at all. 
    All that's ever visible is the frustration,
    with the virtue of a shooting star, uncontrolled
    like a lightning spark in the moonlit sky.
    
    Did you hear a thud that
    came aloof through my walls?
    Could you feel the punch, 
    that could shatter those big ol' ice?
    Those tiny creatures were dying soon,
    as the mighty demon did take the leap;
    the heat around was getting worse, 
    oh god, did they all frown and drown.
    
    The good and the worst, the dark and the bright,
    they all had an endgame,
    just to turn themselves into mere paper cuts,
    without a closure sometimes.
    
    The real question should rather be,
    that if everyone deserves a closure- 
    "no they don't, not all of them."
    Closures aren't inexpensive at all,
    closures surely are expensive......
