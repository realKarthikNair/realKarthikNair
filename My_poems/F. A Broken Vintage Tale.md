# A Broken Vintage Tale

*Nov 11 2022*

    Far away from the world's delusions,
    I found this empty bench;
    Unattended, it lay there,
    temping none, but a chirpy bird

    She did ponder, then she sang oh so well
    that the falling leaves could dance along!
    Such an aura, the place was lit
    I wish if this could go incessant

    Here it came, those iridescent flashbacks,
    that brought me back a memory stream;
    "I know this bench, I know this place,
    this is where we held our hands!"

    The dimensions of time were so unkind,
    it brought me back to the exact place;
    The subtle radiance, it hit my eyes,
    Where is she, with her sparkling eyes?

    The friendly breeze then got eerie,
    hit my back, woke me up!
    Puffed I felt, shattered thoughts,
    the more I stayed, the more it hurt!

    Once again, I left our bench,
    "Ruthless fate, never here again!"
    Back alone, to the world's delusions,
    that at least did not break my soul!
