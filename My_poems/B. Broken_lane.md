# Broken Lane

*January 17 2021*

    So did took that Lamely Path,
    that indeed led me Nowhere;
    Leaning on the Clumsy Wall,
    which infact called me Dumbass

    Walking down the Memory Lane,
    I could hear her Breath;
    Mumbling me to Stop it there,
    stressing me to Give Up..

    The day i saw her Smiling Back,
    which gave me back Some Life;
    But the day i saw me Let it Go,
    The day which Broke my heeds

    Were i been the Darker One,
    who Blindly left the Bright;
    Were i been the Traitor Guy,
    who unjust threw his Shine

    The path was getting Darker through,
    i could see my Demons;
    Standing as much Lively as,
    Guiding me to Move On
