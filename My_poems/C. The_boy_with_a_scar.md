# The Boy With a Scar

*originally written somewhere in the second quarter of 2021, edited and published on 8 May, 2022*

    The little boy did smile for once,
    She wished he could live for more
    The little boy did smile for once,
    She wished this was all a dream

    Lily heard the thud downstairs
    Oh no, came the darkest fate !
    The little boy stood watching her
    As if he could play along

    She could hear the evil spell,
    The silence simply made it worse
    She did weep; the darkest fate
    The little boy did lose his dad !

    The little boy, stood there calm
    foran face his biggest lose
    The footsteps could be heard so clear,
    The evil would be there so soon

    Time was cruel, so was him
    The evil face did scare her soul
    You-Know-Who, did let choose
    Spare the boy and let her free

    She did cover the little boy,
    Pleaded to the evil face -
    Take her instead, spare his life
    The little boy, stood there still !

    Lily didn't move a bit,
    She thus saved her only child
    The evil face then cast a spell,
    The little boy did watch her fall !

    The monster made his eye contact,
    The little boy didn't weep a bit
    You-Know-Who did cast his spell
    The little boy, but did not fall !

    Her love did make the biggest shield
    Which the evil power, could not break
    Harry Potter, The Boy Who lived
    Harry Potter, The Boy With a Scar !
