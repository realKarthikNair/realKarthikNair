# And they said Forever

*24 April 2023*

    The wilted rose in her hand,
    its orange petals, all of it,
    retained some of its scent,
    but in her velvet palm,
    abraded by the vengeance of their deeds.
    
    She carried it neverthless, 
    two more miles to go and she'll be there, 
    two more miles before the 
    sky turns into pink and gold,
    and the wind turns into fading whishper.
    
    The engines did not roar,
    and the car sped like a dart;
    she smiled, seated at the back
    it was almost there, he could be seen,
    a lot has changed, their hair now silvered at last.
    
    she could clearly imagine, what lay ahead
    the warmth of his chest while they hugged,
    the ticking of the clock, the drops of rain,
    their hearts beating as one,
    as if in ethereal vessels.
    
    The car can't halt soon enough, the wait was a pain.
    
    "Can the love be re-spun?", she asked the petals
    while their mortal bodies squeezed one another;
    The rose petals whispered in her ear,
    "Love can be re-spun, when hearts draw near."
    
    It was that moment, she knew it was true,
    their love rekindled, forever anew.
