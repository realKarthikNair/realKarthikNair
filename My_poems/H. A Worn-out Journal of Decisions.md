# A Worn-out Journal of Decisions

*

    Driven by an illusion of choices, 
    decisions were made in binary; 
    little did they know what it cost,
    until those moments were truly relived.
    
    Wrong paths were subjective, 
    so were the pleasant ones;
    "If the brightest star didn't lead your way, 
    how could you expect the moon to?"
    
    The aura of pain and injustice,
    did not stay for the longest time;
    the drops of tears, all of it,
    were absorbed by the cushioned ground!
    
    Time was there, but so much subtle,
    that they heard it ticking, in their heads;
    Remorse was there, so gigantic,
    that they heard it beating, in their hearts.
    
    So insignificant, things were then,
    So unimportant, life was then; 
    "It's never too late", they were wrong,
    It was long ago too late, they knew it well.
    
    The sharpest knife can't cut through them,
    the onshore breeze can't heal them now;
    Remnants of the past were etched deep within,
    Replayed over and over again.
    
    Let go of the penitent memories, 
    tear those pages, from the worn-out journal; 
    another life, is yet to come, 
    lead a life with no more regrets.
