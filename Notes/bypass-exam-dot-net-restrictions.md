### Bypass full screen exit and active window detection 

Method 1: Use 2 workspaces(linux)/desktops(windows). One dedicated to an instance (window) of chrome that runs exam.net and the another workspace/desktop is where you can do anything else undetected. Once the exam starts in full-screen, use the keyboard shortcuts or touchpad gestures to switch between workspaces/desktops, which most probably is Windows Key + Ctrl + Left Arrow or Windows Key + Ctrl + Right Arrow for Windows and ctri+alt+left/right arrow keys for Linux (find it in Settings(gnome-control-panel)\>Keyboard\>View and customize shortcuts for Gnome DE)

method 2: Use [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/always-active-window-alwa/ehllkhjndgnlokhomdlhgbineffifcbj?hl=en-US) extension. Make sure to restart chrome once after installing and enabling the extension.
