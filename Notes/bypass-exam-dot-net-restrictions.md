# Bypass **active window detection**, full-screen quit detection and copy-paste detection of exam.net

### For Linux (assuming Gnome and Chrome is being used)

- **Bypass copy-paste restriction**: Install [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/absolute-enable-right-cli/jdocbkpgdakpekjlhemmfcncgdjeiika?hl=en) extension. 
 Open exam.net, click on the extensions icon, select the extension we just installed and toggle it as shown

- **Bypass full screen exit and active window detection**: Use 2 workspaces. One dedicated to an instance (window) of chrome that runs exam.net and the another workspace is where you can do anything else without being detected.
Once the exam starts in full-screen, use the keyboard shortcuts to switch workspaces, which most probably is ctri+alt+left/right arrow keys to move between workspaces (find it in Settings(gnome-control-panel)\>Keyboard\>View and customize shortcuts)
